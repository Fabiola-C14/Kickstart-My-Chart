# Kickstart-My-Chart

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.


## Analysis

in this project, data was organized and analyzed base on a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

The following questions were addressed in this project:

* Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
* What are some limitations of this dataset?
* What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

## Tasks

* A pivot table was created to analyze the data and count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or a currently live per category.
  * A stacked column pivot chart was created to filter by country based on the table above.
* A pivot table was created and analyze the data and determine how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently liver per sub-category.
  * A stacked column pivot chart was created to filter by country and parent-category.
* A pivot table was created to analyze the data by state and filter by parent category and years.
  * A line graph was created to visualize the table
*The mean and median were calculated to summarize the data more meaningfully, and determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns.
